;;; kixi-locations --- change the locations of things away from user-emacs-directory

;;; Commentary:

;; By default things like to save bits of state or config in your
;; `user-emacs-directory`, which was fine in the old days but is a real
;; pain now that we use things like `--init-directory` to point at
;; different configurations that more or less do the same thing.
;; 
;; This file attempts to move things to `emacs-state-home` so that they
;; donâ€™t clutter up `user-emacs-directory`

;;; Code:

;;; # Enable some good basics
;;  - Find places for the following:
;;    - [x] auto-save-list directory
;;    - [x] bookmarks
;;    - [x] .cache
;;    - [x] diary
;;    - [x] history
;;    - [x] mastodon.plstore
;;    - [x] .org-id-locations
;;    - [x] org-roam.db
;;    - [x] persist
;;    - [x] places
;;    - [x] projects
;;    - [x] recentf
;;    - [x] request
;;    - [x] tramp
;;    - [x] transient
;;    - [x] url
;;    - [x] work-diary
;;    - [x] multisession
